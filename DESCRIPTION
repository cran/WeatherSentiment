Description: A comprehensive suite of functions for processing,
  analyzing, and visualizing textual data from tweets is offered.  
  Users can clean tweets, analyze their sentiments, visualize data, 
  and examine the correlation between sentiments and environmental 
  data such as weather conditions. Main features include text processing,  
  sentiment analysis, data visualization, correlation analysis, and 
  synthetic data generation. Text processing involves cleaning and preparing  
  tweets by removing textual noise and irrelevant words. Sentiment analysis 
  extracts and accurately analyzes sentiments from tweet texts using advanced 
  algorithms. Data visualization creates various charts like word clouds
  and sentiment polarity graphs for visual representation of data. Correlation 
  analysis examines and calculates the correlation between tweet sentiments 
  and environmental variables such as weather conditions. Additionally, 
  random tweets can be generated for testing and evaluating the performance 
  of analyses, empowering users to effectively analyze and interpret 'Twitter' 
  data for research and commercial purposes.
